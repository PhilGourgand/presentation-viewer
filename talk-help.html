      <h1>Sync video and hide transcript</h1>

      <p>You can select whether to read the slides and the video
	transcript, or watch a self-playing slideshow with captions
	(subtitles) that is synchronized with the video.</p>

      <p>When the checkbox is unchecked, you can scroll through the
	slides and the transcript, even while the video is
	playing.</p>

      <p>When the checkbox is checked, the video controls which slide
	is shown. Subtitles corresponding to the video's sound are
	displayed below the slide.</p>

      <!--<p>The subtitles are available in different languages. When
	the checkbox is checked, there is a menu of languages next to
	the subtitles.</p>-->

      <!--<p>Subtitles can also be displayed inside the video. For
	those, click the <span class=cc>CC</span> button in the video
	window.</p>-->

      <p>Click on the video to start or pause it. Or with the
	keyboard: tab to the video and press the space bar.</p>

      <p>Tip: If you don't see the slides and the video at the same
	time, try making your window wider.</p>
