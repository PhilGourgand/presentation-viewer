1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.360
<v ->Hello, I'd like to talk to you</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.220
about the internationalization work

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.163
which we've been doing recently at the W3C.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.990
On slide two, you can see that we grouped the work

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.650
of the Internationalization Activity

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.240
into three main bucket areas.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.480
One is requirements work, which sets out to establish

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.993
what needs to be done to make the Web world-ready.

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.210
One aspect of that is what we'll describe

10
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.050
in this talk as language enablement.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.110
The key stakeholders here are end users of the Web.

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.810
Another area of work is reviewing specifications

13
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.450
and providing advice to developers.

14
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.600
And the third bucket is education and outreach.

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.160
Content authors and developers

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.923
are the key stakeholders here.

17
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.180
The core work is supported by member funding,

18
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540
but additional resources are made available

19
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.673
through the Internationalization Sponsorship Program.

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.800
We've been running that program for two years now

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.400
thanks to sponsorship from Alibaba,

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
the Advanced Publishing Lab in Japan,

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.980
Apple, Monotype, and the Paciello Group,

24
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.760
and we'd like to say a big thank you to them

25
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.610
for their support.

26
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.360
The initial phase will end in the middle of this year

27
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.650
and we are hoping we'll be able

28
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.853
to extend the program beyond that date.

29
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.117
We already have received an intent to renew sponsorship from

30
00:01:22.117 --> 00:01:25.810
APL and Apple, and we're extremely grateful for that.

31
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.260
However, we need to find additional funders.

32
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Slide three gives an overview

33
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.460
of what I plan to cover during this talk.

34
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.300
Time is short, so I'll focus in on the work

35
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.030
that we've been able to do under the umbrella

36
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.750
of the Internationalization Sponsorship Program

37
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.200
and particularly in the area of language enablement.

38
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.870
Language enablement means ensuring that users

39
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.330
around the world are able to use

40
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.333
the Web in their own language.

41
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.480
We'll start by reviewing the framework we developed

42
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.673
to support the language enablement work.

43
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.290
We'll also report progress against

44
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.333
the sponsorship program goals.

45
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.070
Then I'll include two additional sections

46
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.470
that are likely to be of more interest to developers.

47
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.040
I'll introduce the Language Enablement Index

48
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.070
and describe the recent developments

49
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.773
in language enablement tooling.

50
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.630
So let's go to slide four and begin a quick overview

51
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.263
of the language enablement framework that we put in place.

52
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.890
The framework is a set of tools and procedures we developed

53
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.010
that are common to all of the groups

54
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.743
who we currently have working on language enablement.

55
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.730
This enables us to centralize information and efficiently

56
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.323
create new groups and get them up and running.

57
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.140
On slide five, we see some pictures of the Language Matrix.

58
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.150
Note by the way that the images on the following slides

59
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.250
are there to help you visualize

60
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.340
what I'm talking about.

61
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.860
You don't need to read the detail if you're in a hurry.

62
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.220
The Language Matrix brings together all of the work

63
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.100
that we're doing in the form of a heat map.

64
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.040
A set of languages appear down the left side,

65
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.790
ordered by script, and across the top are a set of features

66
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.010
that need to be supported if users around the world

67
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.003
are going to successfully use their own language on the Web.

68
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.460
The intersection of the language row and the feature column

69
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.080
is a coloured box that indicates

70
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.520
(1) whether we have an issue to address,

71
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.563
and (2) what is the severity of that issue if there is one.

72
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.050
So if a cell is coloured dark green

73
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.103
we don't know of any issues, we think we're okay.

74
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.340
If the cell is coloured light green

75
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.230
we believe that there are some barriers to use of the Web,

76
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.240
though they tend to be particularly related

77
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.103
to advanced features.

78
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.890
Orange squares, on the other hand, highlight basic issues

79
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.090
that we believe users will come across regularly

80
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.010
as they try to use the Web in their language,

81
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.493
on an everyday basis.

82
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.050
If you click on any of the colored squares

83
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.850
it'll take you to the relevant section

84
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.970
of a gap analysis document.

85
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.170
You can see an example of part of the gap analysis document

86
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.580
on slide six.

87
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.980
And in these documents we,

88
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.180
(1) describe the problem,

89
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.280
(2) describe the current level of support

90
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.743
in specifications and browsers,

91
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.270
and (3), we attempt to indicate the severity

92
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.993
of the problem for the user.

93
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.760
While you're doing gap analysis work,

94
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.720
it's important to be able to quickly and easily create

95
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.900
tests to explore and monitor what works and what doesn't.

96
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.180
I'll talk later about some recent innovations

97
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.333
there that help.

98
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.870
Slide seven talks about documenting requirements.

99
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.670
As we document gaps, it's important to clarify

100
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.420
what we expect to happen in an ideal situation.

101
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.400
So, for each of the gap analysis documents,

102
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.650
we've tried to create a requirements document that explains

103
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.360
how a script or a language works,

104
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.800
at least for the gaps that we're pointing out.

105
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.320
Slide eight is about networking.

106
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.160
An important aspect of the language enablement work

107
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.530
is to allow experts around the world

108
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.930
to collaborate and follow what's going on,

109
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.200
and the framework we used needs to facilitate that communication.

110
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.600
So we use GitHub issues for our technical discussions,

111
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.280
just like other working groups at the W3C,

112
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.220
but we also pioneered the daily digest mechanism

113
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.210
that informs the experts about developments related

114
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.733
to their language of interest –

115
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.136
not only in the GitHub issues of their own group,

116
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:49.140
but also capturing issues raised by other working groups,

117
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.260
such as CSS, HTML, TTML, SVG, et cetera,

118
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.290
that have a bearing on their language,

119
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.873
so that they remain informed about those developments too.

120
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.670
Moving to slide nine, the end goal of all this activity

121
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.860
is of course to submit requests to spec developers

122
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.640
and implementers where changes are needed.

123
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.100
So we've begun that process,

124
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.450
although the larger focus so far has been

125
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.023
on gathering information and establishing patterns.

126
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.440
But in the next phase we expect to increase the emphasis

127
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.770
on this aspect and we have actually begun already.

128
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.710
Slide 10 summarizes the aspects of the framework

129
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.800
that we just touched upon.

130
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.940
So now let's take a look at the achievements

131
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.090
of the Internationalization Initiative

132
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.800
during its first phase.

133
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.340
And there are five main goals that we set ourselves

134
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.850
at the beginning.

135
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.360
If we look at slide 12, we see the first of those,

136
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.980
which is to widen participation of expert networks

137
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.980
in language enablement groups and by extension in W3C work.

138
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.810
So there are still many places around the world where

139
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.940
the W3C has not penetrated very far

140
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.040
and those places often correspond

141
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.450
quite closely with languages and scripts

142
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.910
that are very different from English.

143
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.540
So a key objective of this exercise,

144
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.440
is to reach out to people in these areas,

145
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.410
make them aware of the work

146
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.200
that we're doing at the W3C,

147
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.660
and get them involved in improving the Web locally by

148
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.650
participating in the groups that we set up.

149
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.350
Slide 12 shows some statistics

150
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.830
around what we've achieved so far.

151
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.560
We have active networks running for Arabic and Persian,

152
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.480
Chinese (Simplified and Traditional),

153
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.740
for Ethiopic languages,

154
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.410
for Indic languages,

155
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.640
for Japanese,

156
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.103
Mongolian and several Southeast Asian languages.

157
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.270
These are all separate groups

158
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.860
dedicated to particular languages or regions

159
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.760
but using the same framework.

160
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.960
We are currently in the process

161
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.000
of establishing two more groups,

162
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.540
one for African languages

163
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.120
and another for European languages.

164
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.630
They're still in the early stages of setup

165
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.130
and we welcome interest from potential participants.

166
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.320
In addition, we have two more groups, Hebrew and Tibetan,

167
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.390
which we started a little while ago but where we need

168
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.960
additional experts to drive that work forward.

169
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.400
So, in total we have 103 experts

170
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.820
signed up to these groups as contributors.

171
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.090
That's 103 sign-ups.

172
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.130
These are people that we rely on to move the work forward

173
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.030
and provide content and expertise.

174
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:38.030
We have 259 subscriptions to our notification lists.

175
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.120
So, this brings in around 150 additional people

176
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.940
who are following the work and may sometimes

177
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.200
participate in discussions.

178
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.460
It may help to measure the work done

179
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.963
by looking at the issues raised in GitHub.

180
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.200
91 issues were raised

181
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.080
that put questions to the language experts.

182
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.520
These are things that working groups at the W3C

183
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.855
need to understand about how languages work.

184
00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:08.580
And so their questions get passed on to the local experts.

185
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.470
In addition, we brought to the attention of these experts

186
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.590
74 issues that the W3C working groups

187
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.540
had raised during their work,

188
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.920
but which have a bearing on

189
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.620
their particular language or writing system.

190
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.050
So overall, the language enablement groups have raised

191
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.060
639 GitHub issues while doing the work in this first phase,

192
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.230
which is quite a good number.

193
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.600
Slide 13 brings us to our second goal:

194
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.120
to increase the scope and documented output

195
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.880
related to language enablement work.

196
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.610
Let's run through a few more statistics

197
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.070
give you an idea of what's been happening.

198
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.680
So, we have 14 gap analysis documents

199
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.570
currently in active development.

200
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.440
One for Arabic and Persian,

201
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.440
another for Simplified and Traditional Chinese.

202
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.450
Another for Ethiopic, which covers

203
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.090
the Amharic and Tigrinya languages.

204
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.710
Devanagari, which is Hindi and Marathi,

205
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.040
Bengali (Bangla and Assamese),

206
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.500
Gurmukhi, which covers the Punjabi language,

207
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.760
Tamil, Gujarati, Japanese, Mongolian,

208
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.900
Javanese in the Javanese script, Khmer, Lao,

209
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.500
and Thai.

210
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.450
And we have requirements

211
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.920
documents backing up most of those documents too.

212
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.710
There are six additional gap analysis documents

213
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.910
which we term 'provisional'

214
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.570
and which have generally been submitted

215
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.810
by an individual but have not been worked on

216
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.030
by a group of experts.

217
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.430
They cover Cree and Inuktitut,

218
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.850
Cherokee, Dutch, Georgian, Greek, and Hungarian.

219
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.490
In addition, the Japanese Layout Task Force

220
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.120
was re-activated during this phase and has been quite busy,

221
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.740
not only producing an editorial update to the famous

222
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.340
Japanese Layout Requirements document

223
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.440
but also considering plans for new versions

224
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.303
of that document.

225
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.130
By the time you read this presentation,

226
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.060
they should have also published a shorter document

227
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.550
called Simple Ruby as a Working Group Note,

228
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.760
which aims to establish a baseline

229
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.810
for Ruby support on the Web.

230
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.540
I mentioned earlier that we raised 15 bugs, typically for

231
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.590
multiple browser implementers,

232
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.840
and we've also begun identifying GitHub issue threads

233
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.440
that can be regarded as useful resources in their own right.

234
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.900
We've so far identified around nine of those,

235
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.640
which give many useful details and examples

236
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.000
related to a particular language or script.

237
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.350
Slide 14 lists the remaining goals.

238
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.820
The first is to address skill building

239
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.680
and succession planning for internationalization.

240
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.970
And I'm happy to say that the program funding

241
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.240
has allowed us to augment the staff resources

242
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.883
dedicated to internationalization.

243
00:11:52.883 --> 00:11:57.883
Atsushi Shimono from Keio and Fuqiao Xue from Beihang

244
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.420
broadened our ability to do core support

245
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.700
as well as adding additional support

246
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.069
for language enablement work.

247
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:11.080
This also helps us to spread the institutional knowledge

248
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.966
about internationalization through the W3C staff,

249
00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:16.650
much more effectively.

250
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.570
The fourth goal was to significantly improve guidelines

251
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.910
and self-review checklists with developers.

252
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.050
The additional resources that I just mentioned

253
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.380
helped us find more time for these core activities.

254
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.070
Not only were we able to improve

255
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.530
the detailed I18n Review Checklist,

256
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.940
but we also developed a new self-review checklist

257
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.460
that W3C working groups can use to identify areas

258
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.450
of their work that are potentially affected

259
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.070
by internationalization considerations.

260
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.830
Significant advances also included the publication

261
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.180
of the Character Model for the Worldwide Web: String Matching,

262
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.070
and another document on strings for the Web

263
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.020
and metadata related to language and direction.

264
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.010
Goal five was related to tests.

265
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:09.030
Earlier this year, we developed a new framework

266
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.980
for exploratory testing,

267
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.340
which I'll describe in more detail later.

268
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.800
This'll be a significant help

269
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.810
for those doing gap analysis work,

270
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.460
but it's also proving useful

271
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.340
for other internationalization work too.

272
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.850
We also migrated a large number of tests from the i18n

273
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.310
test suite to the Web Platform Tests repository.

274
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.910
Testing paged media, however, requires a different approach

275
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.910
to the tests we've done so far,

276
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.310
and we don't have a solution for this yet,

277
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.250
but other groups around the W3C are beginning

278
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.740
to look at this also and we look forward

279
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.000
to collaborating with them on this.

280
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.620
So in summary, on slide 15,

281
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.960
the Internationalization Sponsorship Program was,

282
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.110
in my opinion, successful in enabling additional work

283
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.420
within and beyond the core.

284
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.040
The language enablement initiative

285
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.820
was also very successful in expanding the reach of the W3C

286
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.280
into new areas around the globe and bringing those people

287
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.020
within the circle of the W3C.

288
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.570
So the initial phase is nearing completion,

289
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.060
but much more obviously remains to be done

290
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.400
to ensure that people all around the world can interact

291
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.022
with the Web in their own language or writing system.

292
00:14:21.022 --> 00:14:25.100
We therefore would like to ask you to please help us.

293
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.040
First of all, to find more experts to extend our networks,

294
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.010
particularly in-country people who are motivated

295
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.130
to make the Web work better for their language or script.

296
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.730
But also please contact Jeff Jaffe

297
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.270
if your organization can step up

298
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.710
as a sponsor for the next round.

299
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.290
We need additional sponsors and this is the time

300
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.290
when we need to hear from people.

301
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.840
So there are two more sections to this presentation,

302
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.530
which I think are probably more of interest,

303
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.370
as I said before, to technical people.

304
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.500
I'm going to talk about the Language Enablement Index

305
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.750
and I'm going to talk about some additional innovations

306
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.550
that we've made recently with regard

307
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.113
to the Language Enablement Framework.

308
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.920
So, on slide 17

309
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.060
we start talking about the Language Enablement Index.

310
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.610
Well, basically, this is a document on the Web

311
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.620
which allows you to find all the useful information

312
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.620
that we've been gathering so far in terms of requirements,

313
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.180
and so on, and so forth.

314
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.430
I'll show you some examples

315
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.393
of the kinds of things that you can find there.

316
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.413
And,

317
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.020
it's broken into a number of sections,

318
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.105
and the section headings are harmonized

319
00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:53.105
as a way of categorizing features that we're interested in —

320
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.170
harmonized across all of the

321
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.860
Language Enablement Framework deliverables:

322
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.620
so gap analysis, testing,

323
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.623
you name it,

324
00:16:05.008 --> 00:16:07.570
the Language Matrix as well,

325
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.213
they use similar sections to this document.

326
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.200
So I'll take you through just very briefly to give you

327
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.470
a flavor of what this document has,

328
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.228
showing you a few examples.

329
00:16:24.228 --> 00:16:28.470
The examples I will show are all taken from the first

330
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.470
subsection in the document, which relates to vertical text.

331
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.870
So, slide 18: you can see that the section on vertical text

332
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.640
contains links to requirements and specifications

333
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.213
that are relevant to that particular topic.

334
00:16:47.204 --> 00:16:49.370
And on slide 19,

335
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.430
we look at the result of clicking

336
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.410
on one of the GitHub resources links.

337
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.149
This one is the link for requests for information,

338
00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:03.276
and what you're seeing there is all the requests

339
00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:06.160
that we have out at the moment, still unanswered,

340
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.763
related to vertical text.

341
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.907
So that's quite useful, if you are working on vertical texts

342
00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:16.050
and you want to see what questions are out there

343
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.160
to be answered, then you can just

344
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.190
click on that link and get there.

345
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.070
Similarly, we have another link which takes you

346
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.070
to a set of related issues that have arisen while people

347
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.203
were working on W3C working group specifications,

348
00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.060
and that's on slide 20.

349
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.773
And slide 21:

350
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.900
another link takes you

351
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.700
to a list of implementation bugs

352
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.760
that have been raised.

353
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.910
Slide 22:

354
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.320
this is the link to type samples.

355
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.250
Our Type Samples database contains

356
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.116
real samples of

357
00:17:59.116 --> 00:18:03.757
text features that are currently found in the wild.

358
00:18:03.757 --> 00:18:05.390
And these are some of them,

359
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.373
there's a few more for vertical text.

360
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:14.240
Slide 23: we also point to the I18n Test Suite,

361
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.170
and you can see here an example of the results page

362
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.553
for some of the vertical text tests.

363
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.093
And

364
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.340
we also point to the new exploratory tests,

365
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.683
which I'll mention a bit more in a moment.

366
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.440
So again, here we have a results page

367
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.360
but you can find the actual tests themselves

368
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.370
by clicking on the links that are available there.

369
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:47.280
So in summary the Language Enablement Index is the place

370
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.823
to find the information that we have been gathering.

371
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.120
Our final

372
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.540
section starts on slide 26

373
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.770
and we're going to talk about some recent developments,

374
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.263
which some of you may find quite interesting.

375
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.510
And the first has to do with gap analysis.

376
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.850
And it starts from a problem statement.

377
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.360
And the problem is that GitHub pull requests appear

378
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.240
formidable and difficult to use for many of the people

379
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.883
that we want to involve in developing gap analysis.

380
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.860
And this has been, I think, affecting

381
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.563
the contributions to the work.

382
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.040
So as a solution,

383
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.780
we have moved the content of the gap analysis documents

384
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.453
into GitHub issues.

385
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.460
And then we've put in place a system which means

386
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.970
that any time you change the text

387
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.680
which is in the first comment of a GitHub issue,

388
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.730
that change is immediately reflected in the HTML document

389
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.070
which brings everything together

390
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.900
and allows you to find

391
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.573
all the gap analysis texts in one place.

392
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.190
Benefits for this. It's much easier

393
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.183
and faster to edit content.

394
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.460
It's easier to hold and find discussions

395
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.120
related to a particular topic

396
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.120
because you can add comments to the particular topic

397
00:20:17.388 --> 00:20:20.423
that is in a given issue.

398
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:26.080
And the labeling that we've used on the GitHub issues

399
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.500
allows us to filter

400
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.520
issues in a new and useful way.

401
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.250
I'll just give you a couple of examples.

402
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.173
On page 28,

403
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.960
we see one of the sections from the actual HTML document.

404
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.870
And of course this is a longish document

405
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.263
with many sections and many topics in it.

406
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.740
So this is about table cells

407
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.140
not handling vertical text direction properly,

408
00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.250
but rather than edit the HTML you go over here

409
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:03.250
to this GitHub issue and there's the actual text

410
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.700
that was written

411
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.990
that appears in the slide that you just saw

412
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.603
(that is, in slide 29).

413
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.120
So that's quite easy for people to edit.

414
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.780
You'll see there's some labels on the right hand side.

415
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.133
And then slide 30, we move down that issue a little

416
00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:21.780
and you can see an example of some comments

417
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.040
that somebody raised against the text

418
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.690
and that we then

419
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:31.410
edited in the text. And you can see the edits by

420
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.003
pulling down the Edit pulldown at the top of the issue.

421
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.070
And slide 31

422
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.910
just shows

423
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.743
several

424
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.300
issues

425
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.530
but we've applied some filtering here,

426
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:53.530
so what you're actually seeing is all the basic issues for

427
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.293
the Bengali language and nothing else.

428
00:21:59.357 --> 00:22:01.050
And being able to filter

429
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.750
and sort things in ways like that

430
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.100
is a new thing that is enabled by the fact that we're using

431
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.043
GitHub issues for the content. That's quite useful.

432
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.790
So, so much for gap analysis.

433
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.730
Oh, there's another slide (32)

434
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.170
where we do a different type of filtering.

435
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.813
And so here we've got all the Indic languages

436
00:22:20.813 --> 00:22:24.120
that have an issue related to line-breaking

437
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.973
and you can see what those are.

438
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.750
And this is very useful for comparing across languages

439
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.670
and finding places where we have a comment that also applies

440
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.820
to another language, and so on and so forth.

441
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.160
So, the last topic has to do with exploratory tests.

442
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.700
The problem statement:

443
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.600
it's difficult to learn how to write Web Platform Tests,

444
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.410
and it's quite time consuming to generate all the necessary

445
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.400
files with the correct content,

446
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.620
especially when you're dealing with lots of languages

447
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.970
or small tweaks

448
00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:07.352
that might affect lots of files.

449
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.150
And it's also especially important, for gap analysis work,

450
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.200
to have a very fast and simple way to interactively create

451
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.873
exploratory tests and record results.

452
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.573
So, our solution:

453
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.480
we created test framework pages

454
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.580
with form controls to add text.

455
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.870
You can change languages as well,

456
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.370
change the font, change the box size,

457
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.810
and you can apply various CSS properties.

458
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.060
I'll show you an example of that in a moment.

459
00:23:41.965 --> 00:23:43.370
And then

460
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.830
you can click a single button

461
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.513
and however you've set up that page,

462
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.280
you can record that set up

463
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.190
as a URL,

464
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.130
which you can then paste to somebody in an email

465
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.030
or, you could

466
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.631
paste into a GitHub issue.

467
00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:06.150
And so we've taken lessons

468
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.470
from the gap analysis approach that we took.

469
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.200
We used GitHub issues to provide test instructions

470
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.230
and detailed results.

471
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.213
Again, you'll see examples of these all in a moment.

472
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.900
And any changes in the issue that we have created

473
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.270
for a particular test are immediately reflected

474
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.560
in the HTML results summary documents.

475
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.610
So these are documents that summarize the results for

476
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.260
a given set of tests.

477
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.470
Benefits: again, significantly lowers the barriers

478
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.653
for test production,

479
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.220
which is something that is very important

480
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.300
for the gap analysis work.

481
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.770
It allows for very quick spot checks to be run up

482
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.070
and circulated to others,

483
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.610
not necessarily related to the language enablement stuff.

484
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.100
We've used it in the Internationalization

485
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.820
Working Group for various things already,

486
00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.820
and you put a test together very quickly

487
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.270
and make it into a URL and send it off to somebody.

488
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.590
It allows discussion of the tests

489
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.320
because you have comment fields underneath

490
00:25:14.118 --> 00:25:15.368
the comment that contains

491
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.170
the test information itself.

492
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.220
And it's especially useful for exploratory tests

493
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.630
which require many small tweaks and replication

494
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.880
across multiple languages.

495
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.970
And again issue labeling allows for novel and useful ways

496
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.533
of filtering and sorting the tests that we have.

497
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.360
So, page 35,

498
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.260
sorry, slide 35.

499
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.610
We have an example of a test page that has been filled out.

500
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.430
You can see I've set the language to Amharic.

501
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.290
I've set the width of the text boxes

502
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.990
to a particular width

503
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.130
and I've put some text below that slider

504
00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.210
which, when you press the GO button, appears in the two

505
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:04.110
orange-bounded boxes below. The top one is plain HTML

506
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.760
and the one below it is a textarea.

507
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.040
So you can compare it and see whether there are differences.

508
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.173
Sometimes there are.

509
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.580
On slide 36, we slide down that page a little

510
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.070
and you can see that we can also set various CSS properties

511
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.070
related to line breaking and word breaking.

512
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.280
And then right at the bottom of the page there's a button,

513
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.280
'Take a snapshot'; you click on that

514
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.280
and it puts a URL into the box alongside and highlights it

515
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.570
for you, so you can just copy-paste it.

516
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.440
And there you have all the information to recreate that page

517
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.990
the way that you had set it up.

518
00:26:42.181 --> 00:26:45.080
Then, if you want to keep that test

519
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.730
and make it part of the test suites

520
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.760
that we have you go out to GitHub

521
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.683
and you create a GitHub issue, like this, for example.

522
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.920
The assertion is in the title:

523
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.270
“If word-break: break-all is applied, the word separator

524
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.030
does not wrap to the beginning of a line alone”.

525
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.123
That's our assertion.

526
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.120
Then below that, we have the first comment,

527
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.330
which contains a link to the test

528
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.700
with the URL that we've generated.

529
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.320
It contains then some instructions on how to run the test.

530
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.990
And then below that it contains results, detailed results

531
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.373
from the major browsers that we've tested.

532
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.440
Again, we have labels attached to that GitHub issue

533
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.350
which enable us to aggregate the information.

534
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.076
If you look on slide 38, you can see a test page

535
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:46.076
(or part of a test page) which is related to line breaking,

536
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.920
where we have some tests for Amharic

537
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.197
and we show the results for the major browsers,

538
00:27:51.197 --> 00:27:54.300
and that information is generated automatically

539
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.773
from the GitHub issues.

540
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.450
So, that's it really, those two innovations really

541
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.780
should make it a lot easier for people doing gap analysis

542
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.203
to do some of the critical work that they need to.

543
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.570
So, on slide 39

544
00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.570
and slide 40,

545
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.160
summing up the Internationalization Sponsorship Program,

546
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.340
as I've said, it's been running for a couple of years now.

547
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.670
We'd like to continue that

548
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.850
but we need some more sponsors to step up.

549
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.980
So please contact Jeff Jaffe

550
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.120
if your organization is able to step up to sponsor us

551
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.653
to keep up this good work that we've been doing.

552
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.900
For the developers and implementers,

553
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.840
we'd like to encourage you to use

554
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.550
the Language Enablement Index to find information

555
00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.173
about worldwide Web support,

556
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.900
to use the new exploratory test mechanism

557
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.700
and check out the results, and to follow and contribute

558
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.003
to the gap analysis work as well.

559
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.280
And that's all I have for today.

560
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.420
So thank you very much for listening.

561
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.610
And I look forward to working with you

562
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.813
on internationalization at some point in the near future.
